# Buildnode: A libary to ease interaction with cxml:dom documents and nodes

## Examples 

Please see the examples directory for runable examples in each XML dialect

## Primary Goals
 * To define packages of functions that can generate specific xml 
   dialects (see the src/tags directory and associated asd files).

 * To add iterate drivers for various dom interactions
 
 * To provide a reasonable base of funcationality for smoothing 
   common dom interactions such as:
   * adding, removing, moving nodes
   * adjusting attributes and values
   * adjusting css classes

 * To provide a flexible tool for programatically generating 
   and manipulating various and sundry xml formats
